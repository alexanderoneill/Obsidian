# EC2 Basics
**Most popular AWS offering**.
Stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud**.
Comprised of:
- Rented virtual machines (EC2)
- Virtual drives (EBS)
- Load balancers (ELB)
- Automatic scaling of services (ASG)
## EC2 Sizing and Configuration Options
The following options can be configured when creating an EC2 instance.
- OS (Linux, Windows, or MacOS)
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage space (Network drives like EBS or EFS, and hardware drives like EC2 Instance Store)
- Network (Speed of NIC, public IP address)
- Firewall rules (Via security group)
- Bootstrap script (Script to run on launch, **stored in EC2 User Data**)
## EC2 User Data
Used to **automate boot tasks**.
Common uses include:
- Installing updates
- Installing software
- Downloading files from internet
**EC2 User Data scripts run with root user permissions**
# EC2 Instance Types Basics
There are many different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for many different purposes:
- General purpose
- Compute optimised
- Memory optimised
- Accelerated computing
- Storage optimised
## EC2 Instance Naming
Instance names encode information about the instance, for example, **m5.2xlarge**:
- **m**: Instance class (general purpose)
- **5**: Instance class generation
- **2xlarge**: Instance size
## EC2 General Purpose
Good for **diverse workloads**, eg:
- Web servers
- Code repositories
Provide **a balance between CPU, RAM, and Network speeds**
Names begin with either **M** or **T**, eg:
- M7g
- M5zn
- T4g
- T2
## EC2 Compute Optimised
Good for **compute-intensive tasks**, for example:
- Batch processing workloads
- Media transcoding
- High performance web servers
- High performance computing (HPC)
- Scientific modeling & machine learning
- Dedicated gaming servers
Names begin with **C**, eg:
- C7gn
- C5a
## EC2 Memory Optimised
Good for workloads that process **large data sets in memory**, for example:
- High performance, (non-)relational databases
- Distributed web scale cache stores
- In-memory databased optimised for business intelligence (BI)
- Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
Names usually start with either **R** or **X**, but there are instance types that start with **z**, for example:
- R7g
- R4
- X2gd
- X1e
- High Memory
- z1d
## EC2 Storage Optimised
Good for **storage-intensive tasks that require high sequential read/write access to large data sets on local storage**, eg:
- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
- Relational and NoSQL databases
- Cache for in-memory databases (Redis)
- Data warehousing
- Distributed file systems
Names begin with either **I**, **D**, or **H**
## EC2 Instance Types Examples
|Instance|vCPU|Memory (GiB)|Storage|Network Performance|EBS Bandwidth (Mbps)|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|t2.micro*|1|1|EBS-Only|Low to Moderate||
|t2.xlarge|4|16|EBS-Only|Moderate||
|c5d.4xlarge|16|32|1x 400 NVMe SSD|Up to 10Gbps|4750|
|r5.16xlarge|64|512|EBS Only|20 Gbps|13600|
|m5.8xlarge|32|128|EBS Only|10 Gbps|6800|
*\*t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier for up to 750 hrs / mo*
# Security Groups & Classic Ports Overview
Security Groups are the foundation of network security in AWS.
They control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 instances.
**They only contain Allow rules**, anything that is not explicitly allowed is denied.
Security Group rules can reference specific IP addresses or other Security Groups.
![[2.1 Security Groups.svg]]
Security Groups are functionally firewalls on EC2 instances. They regulate:
- Port access
- Authorised IP ranges (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Control of inbound and outbound network messages

|Type|Protocol|Port Range|Source|Description|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|HTTP|TCP|80|0.0.0.0/0|test http page|
|SSH|TCP|22|122.149.196.85/32||
|Custom TCP Rule|TCP|4567|0.0.0.0/0|java app|
