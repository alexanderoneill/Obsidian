# S3 Overview
- Amazon S3 is one of t he main building blocks of AWS
- It's advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage
- Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
- Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well
## Amazon S3 Use Cases
- Backup and storage
- Disaster recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes and big data analytics
- Software delivery 
- Static websites
- E.g. Nasdaq stores 7 years of data in S3 Glacier
- E.g. Sysco runs analytics on its data and gain business insights
## Amazon S3 Buckets
- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name across all regions and all accounts
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention:
	- No uppercase, no underscore
	- 3-63 characters long
	- Not an IP
	- Must start with lowercase letter or number
	- Must not start with the prefix xn--
	- Must not end with the suffix -s3alias
## Amazon S3 Objects
- Objects (files) have a Key
- The key is the FULL path
	- s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
	- s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
- The key is composed of **prefix** + *object name*
	- s3://my-bucket/**my_folder1/another_folder/** *my_file.txt*
	- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
	- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes
- Object values are the content of the body
	- Max object size is 5TiB
	- If uploading more than 5GiB, must use "multi-part upload"
