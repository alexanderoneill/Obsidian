# Amazon RDS Overview
RDS Stands for Relational Database Service. Amazon RDS is a managed DB service for SQL DBs. The following databases are supported:
- Postgres
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Orcale
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Aurora (Proprietary AWS DB)
RDS is a managed service, which means Amazon provides the following features out-of-the-box:
- Automated provisioning
- OS patching
- Rolling backups
- Point-in-time restore
- Monitoring dashboards
- Read replicas
- Multi-AZ DR setup
- Maintenance windows
- Scaling capability
- EBS-backed storage (using gp2 or io1 volumes)
However, you cannot SSH into RDS instances.
## RDS Storage Auto Scaling
RDS Storage Auto Scaling allows the available storage space in an RDS DB instance to be automatically scaled up or down depending on demand. It is dependent on the **Maximum Storage Threshold** value. For example, it can automatically modify storage if:
- Free storage is less that 10% of allocated storage
- Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
- 6 hours have passed since last modification
Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads, and has support for all RDS DB engines (see above).
# RDS Read Replicas vs Multi AZ
## Read Replicas
- Allows up to 15 Read Replicas
- RRs can be within AZ, Cross AZ, or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are **eventually** consistent
- Replicas can be promoted to their own master DBs
![[6.1 RDS Read Replicas.png]]
## Read Replicas - Use Cases
- You have a production database that is taking on normal load
- You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
- You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
- The production application is unaffected
## Read Replicas - Network Cost
- In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
- For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee
## RDS Multi AZ
- SYNC replication
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
- Increases availability
- Failover in case of AZ loss, network loss, or instance / storage failure
- No manual intervention in apps
- Not used for scaling

## RDS From Single AZ to Multi AZ
- Zero downtime operation (No need to stop DB)
- Snapshot is taken
- New DB is restored from the snapshot in new AZ
- Synchronisation is established between the two databases

# RDS Custom for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server
- A Managed Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server Database with OS and database customisation options
- RDS: Automates setup, operation, and scaling of AWS DB
- Custom: Access to the underlying database and OS so you can:
	- Configure settings
	- Install patches
	- Enable native features
	- Access the underlying EC2 Instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager
- Deactivate Automation Mode to perform your customisation, better to take a DB snapshot before
- RDS vs RDS Custom
	- RDS: Entire database and the OS to be managed by AWS
	- RDS Custom: Full admin access to the underlying OS and the database
