# Amazon RDS Overview
#RDS #Aurora #Availability-Zones #Auto-Scaling-Group #EBS 
RDS Stands for Relational Database Service. Amazon RDS is a managed DB service for SQL DBs. The following databases are supported:
- Postgres
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Orcale
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Aurora (Proprietary AWS DB)
RDS is a managed service, which means Amazon provides the following features out-of-the-box:
- Automated provisioning
- OS patching
- Rolling backups
- Point-in-time restore
- Monitoring dashboards
- Read replicas
- Multi-AZ DR setup
- Maintenance windows
- Scaling capability
- EBS-backed storage (using gp2 or io1 volumes)
However, you cannot SSH into RDS instances.
## RDS Storage Auto Scaling
#RDS #Auto-Scaling-Group 
RDS Storage Auto Scaling allows the available storage space in an RDS DB instance to be automatically scaled up or down depending on demand. It is dependent on the **Maximum Storage Threshold** value. For example, it can automatically modify storage if:
- Free storage is less that 10% of allocated storage
- Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
- 6 hours have passed since last modification
Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads, and has support for all RDS DB engines (see above).
# RDS Read Replicas vs Multi AZ
## Read Replicas
- Allows up to 15 Read Replicas
- RRs can be within AZ, Cross AZ, or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are **eventually** consistent
- Replicas can be promoted to their own master DBs

## Read Replicas - Use Cases
- You have a production database that is taking on normal load
- You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
- You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
- The production application is unaffected
## Read Replicas - Network Cost
- In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
- For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee
## RDS Multi AZ
- SYNC replication
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
- Increases availability
- Failover in case of AZ loss, network loss, or instance / storage failure
- No manual intervention in apps
- Not used for scaling

## RDS From Single AZ to Multi AZ
- Zero downtime operation (No need to stop DB)
- Snapshot is taken
- New DB is restored from the snapshot in new AZ
- Synchronisation is established between the two databases
