# EBS Overview
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive that can be attached to instances during runtime.
It allows the persisting of data between instance terminations.
They can only be mounted (attached) to one instance at a time unless Multi-Attach is invoked.
They are bound to a specific AZ.
The Free tier of AWS allows up to 30GiB of EBS General Purpose Storage (SSD) or Magnetic per month.
An EBS Volume is a network drive, meaning that both network bandwidth and disk IO speed can be bottlenecks. The tradeoff for this is that they can be swapped between EC2 instances quickly.
EBS Volumes are locked to an AZ unless you use snapshots to migrate the contents.
EBS Volumes have a provisioned capacity in GiBs and IOPS and you will be billed for the entirety of this capacity regardless of if it is used. This capacity can be increased.
![[4.1 EBS Volumes Example.svg]]
EBS Volumes are volatile by default but can be made non-volatile by disabling the Delete on Termination attribute via the AWS Console or AWS CLI.
# EBS Snapshots
EBS Snapshots can be used to make a backup of an EBS Volume.
It is recommended (but not necessary) to detach a volume before snapshotting it.
Snapshots are not bound to any AZ.

## EBS Snapshot Features
EBS Snapshot Archive
- Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
- Takes 24-72 hours to restore the snapshot
EBS Snapshot Recycle Bin
- Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots to allow for recovery after accidental deletion
- The retention period can be specified between 1 day to 1 year
Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
- Force full initialisation of the snapshot to eliminate latency on first use
- Expensive
# AMI Overview
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are **customised EC2 Instances**, allowing for custom software, configurations, OSs, monitoring systems, etc. Usually has a faster boot / config as all the software is pre-packaged.
AMIs are built for a specific region, and can be copied across regions.
AMI configurations can be provided by AWS (Public AMI), developed in-house, or bought from a third-party vendor (AWS Marketplace AMI).
To create an AMI, you start with a base EC2 Instance, adjusting configurations and installing software as desired.
You then must stop the instance to preserve data integrity.
You then create an AMI from the EC2 Instance, this will copy configurations and installed packages, OSs, etc. This will also create EBS snapshots.
Launch an EC2 Instance via this new AMI.
# EC2 Instance Store
While EBS Volumes are network drives with good but limited performance, EC2 Instance Stores are high-performance hardware disks.
Instance Stores generally have better IO performance but are volatile.
They are good for buffers, caches, scratch data, etc.
Their volatility means they are vulnerable to hardware failure.
Backups and replication are the user's responsibility.

# EBS Volume Types
EBS Volumes come in 6 types:
- gp2/gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volumes, balance of performance and price
- io1/io2 (SSD): High performance SSD for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
- st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed high-throughput workloads
- sc1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
EBS Volumes are characterised by Size, Throughput, and IOPS.
Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes.
## GP2 / GP3
GP2
- Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000
- Volume size and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,00
- 3 IOPS per GiB -> 5,334GiB is max
GP3
- Baseline of 3,000 IOPS
- Baseline of 125MiB/s throughput
- Can increase IOPs and throughput to 16,000 and 1,000MiB/s respectively
Use cases:
- Cost effective storage
- System boot volumes
- Virtual desktops
- Test environments
## IO1 / IO2
IOPS are provisioned.
Supports Multi-Attach
IO1 / IO2
- Min 4GiB - Max 16TiB
- Max IOPS of 64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances and 32,000 for all others
- Can increase IOPS independently from storage size
- io2 has more durability and more IOPS per GiB than io1 despite being the same price
IO2 Block Express
- Min 4GiB - Max 64TiB
- Sub-millisecond latency
- Max IOPS of 256,000
- IOPS : GiB ratio of 1,000 : 1
## ST1 / SC1
Cannot be a boot volume
Min 125GiB - Max 16TiB
ST1
- Throughput optimised
- Max throughput of 500MiB/s
- Max IOPS of 500
SC1
- Cold storage optimised
- Max throughput of 250MiB/s
- Max IOPS of 250
## Summary
![[4.1 EBS Volume Types Summary - SSD.png]]
![[4.2 EBS Volume Types Summary - HDD.png]]
# EBS Multi-Attach
EBS Multi-Attach allows EBS Volumes of the io1 / io2 family to be attached to multiple EC2 Instances within the same AZ.
Each instance has full read and write permissions to the volume,
Volumes can be attached to up to 16 instances at a time.
The volume must use a file system that is cluster aware.
Useful for increasing clustered application availability, although race conditions must be managed at the application layer.
# EBS Encryption
EBS Volumes can be encrypted, which affects data at rest, in flight, snapshots, and volumes created from that snapshot.
Encryption and decryption are handled automatically.
This has a minimal impact on latency.
Volumes created from unencrypted snapshots can be encrypted.
To encrypt a volume that is already attached to an instance:
- Create an snapshot of the volume
- Encrypt the snapshot
- Create new volume from snapshot
- Attach volume to instance
# Amazon EFS
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a Managed Network File System (NFS) that can be mounted on any EC2.
EFS works with EC2 instances in multiple AZs.
High availability and scalability.
Very expensive
Use cases include content management, web serving, data sharing, etc.
Uses the NFSv4.1 protocol.
- POSIX file system
- Standard file API
- Auto scaling
- Pay per use
Operates under a security group
Compatible with Linux only
Encryption at rest uses KMS
## EFS Classes
### Performance
EFS Scale
- 1000s of concurrent NFS clients
- 10GiB+ throughput
- Can scale to the petabyte level
Performance Mode
- General Purpose (Default): Latency-sensitive use cases
- Max I/O: Higher latency and throughput, highly parallel
Throughput Mode
- Bursting: 1TiB = 50MiB/s + bursts to 100MiB/s
- Provisioned: Set throughput regardless of storage size
- Elastic: Auto scales depending on workloads
	- Up to 3GiB/s for reads and 1GiB/s for writes
### Storage
Standard
- For frequently accessed files
Infrequent Access
- Incurs retrieval costs
It is possible to define a lifecycle policy that determines when files are moved between EFS Storage Classes (i.e. if a file is not access for X days, move from Standard storage to EFS-IA (Infrequent Access) storage).
### Availability and Durability
Standard
- Multi-AZ
One Zone
- One AZ
# EFS vs EBS
## EBS
Elastic Block Storage
- One instance (Except for multi-attach io1 / io2)
- AZ-locked
- Root EBS volumes are volatile by default
- gp2: IO increases if disk size increases
- io1: can increase IO independently of disk dize
To migrate EBS volume across AZ
- Copy volume to snapshot
- Restore snapshot to different AZ
- Snapshotting is IO intensive
## EFS
Elastic File System
- Mounting 100s of instances across many AZs
- Only supports Linux instances
- More expensive than EBS
- Can leverage EFS-IA to mitigate costs
