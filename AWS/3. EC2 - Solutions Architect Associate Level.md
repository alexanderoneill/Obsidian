## Private vs Public vs Elastic IP
### IPv4 vs IPv6
AWS supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
IPv4 is the most common address type
It allows for **3.7 billion** different addresses in the public space
IPv6 is more for IoT devices
![[3.1 Private vs Public IP (IPv4).svg]]
### Public IPs
Public IPs are device addresses that are **visible to the public internet**
They **must be unique across the entire public internet**
Can easily be geo-located
### Private IPs
Private IPs are **local within their private network**
They **must be unique within the private network** but **devices from different networks can have the same private IP**
Devices connect to the public internet via an **internet gateway** (or proxy)
**Only a specified range of IPs can be used as a private IP**
### Elastic IPs
**EC2 instances have dynamic public addresses** that change on startup
**Elastic IPs allow EC2 instances to utilise static addresses**
**Elastic IPs can only be attached to one instance at a time**
**Elastic IPs allow for a form of failover** in that you can rapidly **reassign an instance's address to another instance** in the event that the first instance fails.
By default you can only have **5 Elastic IPs in your account**, although **this can be increased by requesting more from AWS.**
It is recommended to **avoid using Elastic IPs**, as **they often reflect poor architectural decisions**, **use a random public IP and register a DNS name** to it or **use a load balancer** instead.
## EC2 Placement Groups
Placement groups allow us to **manually control the strategy for physically placing EC2 instances**, this can be specified as one of the following strategies:
- **Cluster**: Clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone.
- **Spread**: Spreads instances across underlying hardware (max. 7 instances per group per AZ). **Good for critical applications**.
- **Partition**: Spreads instances across many different partitions within an AZ. Scales to 100s of instances per group. **Good for applications like Kafka**.
### Cluster
![[3.2 Placement Groups - Cluster.svg]]
Pros:
- Great network bandwidth (**10Gbps** between instances)
Cons:
- **All instances are vulnerable to rack failure**
Use case:
- Big data jobs that require rapid completion
- Any application that requires **extremely l ow latency and high network throughput** (Time Series Databases)
### Spread
![[3.3 Placement Groups - Spread.svg]]
Pros:
- **Can span across AZs**
- Reduced risk of simultaneous hardware failure
Cons:
- **Limited to 7 instances per AZ per Placement Group**
Use case:
- Application that needs to **maximise high availability**
- Critical applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other
### Partition
![[3.4 Placement Groups - Partition.svg]]
Pros:
- **Can support hundreds of EC2 instances**
- Instances in one partition are resistant to rack failure in another partition
- Can support up to **7 partitions per AZ**
Cons:
- Partition failure can impact multiple AZs
Use case:
- Any application that supports **partition-aware operations** or distributed processing (Kafka)
## Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
An ENI is a logical component in a VPC that represents a **virtual network card**.
An ENI can have:
- Primary private IPv4
- One or more secondary IPv4
- One elastic IPv4 per IPv4
- One public IPv4
- One or more security groups
- One MAC address
You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly to EC2 instances for failover, however they are **limited to within an Availability Zone.**
