## Private vs Public vs Elastic IP
### IPv4 vs IPv6
AWS supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
IPv4 is the most common address type
It allows for 3.7 billion different addresses in the public space
IPv6 is more for IoT devices

### Public IPs
Public IPs are device addresses that are visible to the public internet
They must be unique across the entire public internet
Can easily be geo-located
### Private IPs
Private IPs are local within their private network
They must be unique within the private network but devices from different networks can have the same private IP
Devices connect to the public internet via an internet gateway (or proxy)
Only a specified range of IPs can be used as a private IP
### Elastic IPs
EC2 instances have dynamic public addresses that change on startup
Elastic IPs allow EC2 instances to utilise static addresses
Elastic IPs can only be attached to one instance at a time
Elastic IPs allow for a form of failover in that you can rapidly reassign an instance's address to another instance in the event that the first instance fails.
By default you can only have 5 Elastic IPs in your account, although this can be increased by requesting more from AWS.
It is recommended to avoid using Elastic IPs, as they often reflect poor architectural decisions, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it or use a load balancer instead.
