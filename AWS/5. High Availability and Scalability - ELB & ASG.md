## High Availability and Scalability
Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads.
There are two kinds of scalability: vertical and horizontal.
Scalability and Availability are linked but separate
### Vertical Scalability
Vertical scalability means allocating more resources to an application instance.
For example, if the application runs on a t2.micro, scaling it vertically would mean running it on a t2.large.
This kind of scaling is common for non-distributed systems such as a database.
RDS and ElastiCache are vertically-scalable services.
There is usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale.
### Horizontal Scalability
Horizontal scalability means increasing the number of application instances.
This kind of scalability implicitly requires the application to be able to be distributed and parallelised.
This kind of scaling is common for modern web applications, especially cloud-based applications thanks to services like Amazon EC2.
### Availability
Horizontal scalability usually goes hand in hand with availability. In AWS terms, high availability means running your application in at least two Availability Zones.
Availability can be passive (RDS Mutli-AZ) or active (horizontal scaling)
