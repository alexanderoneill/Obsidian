## High Availability and Scalability
Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads.
There are two kinds of scalability: vertical and horizontal.
Scalability and Availability are linked but separate
### Vertical Scalability
Vertical scalability means allocating more resources to an application instance.
For example, if the application runs on a t2.micro, scaling it vertically would mean running it on a t2.large.
This kind of scaling is common for non-distributed systems,
