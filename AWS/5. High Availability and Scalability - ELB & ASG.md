## High Availability and Scalability
#EC2 #Availability-Zones #RDS #ElastiCache #Auto-Scaling-Group #RDS #ElastiCache 
Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads.
There are two kinds of scalability: **vertical and horizontal.**
Scalability and Availability are linked but separate
### Vertical Scalability
Vertical scalability means **allocating more resources to an application instance**.
For example, if the application runs on a t2.micro, scaling it vertically would mean running it on a t2.large.
This kind of scaling is common for **non-distributed systems** such as a database.
RDS and ElastiCache are vertically-scalable services.
There is usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale.
### Horizontal Scalability
Horizontal scalability means **increasing the number of application instances.**
This kind of scalability implicitly requires the application to be able to be **distributed and parallelised.**
This kind of scaling is common for modern web applications, especially cloud-based applications thanks to services like Amazon EC2.
### Availability
Horizontal scalability usually goes hand in hand with availability. In AWS terms, high availability means **running your application in at least two Availability Zones.**
Availability can be passive (RDS Mutli-AZ) or active (horizontal scaling)
### High Availability & Scalability for EC2
Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size
Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (via **Auto Scaling Group or Load Balancer**)
High Availability: Run multiple instances of the same application across multiple AZs
## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
#ELB #EC2 #Auto-Scaling-Group #ECS #CloudWatch #ACM #Route-53 #WAF #Global-Accelerator #Security-Groups #CLB #ALB #NLB #GWLB
Load balancers forward traffic to the most available server (EC2 Instances).
Load balancers act as a single point of access to scalable applications.
They also increase reliability as they can divert traffic away from failed instances
They can separate public traffic from private traffic.
They can perform regular instance health checks
As for the Elastic Load Balancer, it can:
- Provide SSL termination for your websites
- Enforce stickiness with cookies
- Provide high availability across AZs

ELBs are **managed by AWS**, meaning AWS
- Guarantees it will be working
- **Takes care of upgrades, maintenance, and high availability**
- Provides only a few configurable options
It is also **integrated with many AWS offerings**, including
- EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, ECS
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
- Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator
Setting up a non-managed load balancer is more effort but less expensive.
Load balancers **operate under security groups**.
### Health Checks
**Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers** as they allow the load balancer to know if instances are available to forward traffic to.
Health checks are done on a port / route (:/health is common)
**If the response is not code 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy**
### Load Balancer Types
AWS has 4 types of managed load balancers:
- Classic Load Balancer (2009) (Deprecated)
- Application Load Balancer (2016)
- Network Load Balancer (2017)
- Gateway Load Balancer (2020)
## Application Load Balancer (ALB)
#ALB #ECS #EC2 #Lambda 
The ALB operates at **Layer 7 (Application - HTTP)**
It can load balance to multiple HTTP applications on the same or different machines.
It supports **HTTP/2 and WebSocket** and **redirects**.
Operates with **~400ms latency.**

Can route traffic to different target groups (machines) based on several criteria:
- URL Path (\e\x\a\m\p\l\e.com/**users** vs \e\x\a\m\p\l\e.com/**posts**)
- URL Hostname (**one.example.com** vs **other.example.com**)
- Query String and Headers (\e\x\a\m\p\l\e.com/users?**id=123&order=false**)
ALBs are a great fit for **micro services** and **container based applications** like Docker and Amazon ECS.
The ALB has a port mapping feature to **redirect to a dynamic port** in ECS.
### ALB Target Groups
- EC2 Instances
- ECS Tasks
- Lambda Functions
- Private IP Addresses
The ALB can route to more than one group at a time.
**Health checks are performed at this level too.**

## Network Load Balancer (NLB)
#NLB #Availability-Zones #Elastic-IP #EC2 #ALB 
The NLB operates at **Layer 4 (Transport - TCP / UDP).**
It can handle **millions of requests per second.**
The NLB has **one static IP per AZ but supports Elastic IPs.**
Operates with **~100ms latency.**
**NLB Health Checks support TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols.**
![[5.2 Network Load Balancer.svg]]
### NLB Target Groups
- EC2 Instances
- Private IP Addresses
- ALB
## Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
#GWLB #EC2 
The GWLB operates at Layer 3 (Network)
Combines a Transparent Network Gateway (Single Point of Access for all traffic) with a Load Balancer
Uses the GENEVE protocol on port 6081
### GWLB Target Groups
- EC2 Instances
- Private IP Addresses
## ELB - Sticky Sessions
#ELB #ALB #CLB #EC2 
#### Session Affinity
Sticky sessions allow the same user to always be directed to the same instance behind the load balancer.
This works for the CLB, ALB, and NLB,
The cookie used for stickiness has a configurable expiration date.
However, stickiness can impact the effectiveness of load balancing.
#### Cookie Names
Application Based Cookies:
- Custom Cookie
	- Generated by target (application)
	- Can include any custom attributes required by target
	- Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
	- Cannot be named AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, or AWSALBTG
- Application Cookie
	- Generated by Load Balancer
	- Name is always AWSALBAPP
Duration Based Cookies:
- Generated by Load Balancer
- Name is always AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB
## ELB - Cross Zone Load Balancing
#ELB #ALB #NLB #GWLB #CLB #Availability-Zones 
Cross Zone Load Balancing allows the Load Balancer to distribute traffic across all registered instances across every AZ. Without it, traffic can only be routed to instances within the same AZ.

|                                | ALB | NLB | GWLB | CLB |
| ------------------------------ | --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Enabled by Default             | Yes | No  | No   | No  |
| Charges for inter-zone traffic | No  | Yes | Yes  | No  |

## ELB - SSL Certificates
#ELB #ACM #HTTPS-Listener #SNI
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Certificates allow traffic between clients and Load Balancer to be encrypted in transit.
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a newer version of SSL which is more widely used, but is still referred to as SSL.
Public SSL certs are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA) such as Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt, etc.
SSL certs have expiration dates and must be renewed.

Load balancers use an X.509 cert.
Certs can be managed using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager).
You can also create and upload your own certs.
HTTPS Listener:
- You must specify a default cert
- Optional list of certs can be added to support multiple domains
- Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
- Can specify a security policy to support legacy SSL clients

#### SNI - Server Name Indication
SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certs onto one web server.
It is a newer protocol and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake.
The server will then find the correct cert or return the default.

This only works for ALB, new generation NLB, and CloudFront.
This does not work for older generation CLB.

|                            | CLB | ALB | NLB |
| -------------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Can support multiple certs | No  | Yes | Yes |
| Supports SNI               | No  | Yes | Yes |

## ELB - Connection Draining
Connection Draining, also known as Deregistration Delay for ALBs and NLBs, refers to the time taken to complete in-flight requests while the EC2 instance is deregistering or unhealthy
