## EBS Overview
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive that can be attached to instances during runtime.
It allows the persisting of data between instance terminations.
They can only be mounted (attached) to one instance at a time at the CCP level.
They are bound to a specific AZ.
The Free tier of AWS allows up to 30GiB of EBS General Purpose Storage (SSD) or Magnetic per month.
