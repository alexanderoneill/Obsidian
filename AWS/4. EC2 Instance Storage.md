## EBS Overview
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a **network drive** that can be **attached to instances during runtime.**
It allows the persisting of data between instance terminations.
They can only be mounted (attached) to one instance at a time unless Multi-Attach is invoked.
They are bound to a specific AZ.
The Free tier of AWS allows up to 30GiB of EBS General Purpose Storage (SSD) or Magnetic per month.

An EBS Volume is a network drive, meaning that both network bandwidth and disk IO speed can be bottlenecks. The tradeoff for this is that they can be swapped between EC2 instances quickly.
EBS Volumes are locked to an AZ unless you use snapshots to migrate the contents.
EBS Volumes have a provisioned capacity in GiBs and IOPS and you will be billed for the entirety of this capacity regardless of if it is used. This capacity can be increased.

EBS Volumes are volatile by default but can be made non-volatile by disabling the Delete on Termination attribute via the AWS Console or AWS CLI.
