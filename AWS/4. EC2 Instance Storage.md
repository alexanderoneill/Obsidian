## EBS Overview
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a **network drive** that can be **attached to instances during runtime.**
It allows the **persisting of data between instance terminations**.
They **can only be mounted (attached) to one instance at a time unless Multi-Attach is invoked**.
They are **bound to a specific AZ.**
The Free tier of AWS allows up to 30GiB of EBS General Purpose Storage (SSD) or Magnetic per month.

An EBS Volume is a network drive, meaning that both network bandwidth and disk IO speed can be bottlenecks. The tradeoff for this is that they can be swapped between EC2 instances quickly.
EBS Volumes are locked to an AZ **unless you use snapshots to migrate the contents**.
EBS Volumes have a provisioned capacity in GiBs and IOPS and **you will be billed for the entirety of this capacity regardless of if it is used**. This capacity can be increased.

EBS Volumes are **volatile by default** but can be made non-volatile by **disabling the Delete on Termination attribute** via the AWS Console or AWS CLI.
## EBS Snapshots
EBS Snapshots can be used to make a backup of an EBS Volume.
It is recommended (but not necessary) to detach a volume before snapshotting it.
Snapshots are not bound to any AZ.

### EBS Snapshot Features
EBS Snapshot Archive
- Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
- Takes 24-72 hours to restore the snapshot
EBS Snapshot Recycle Bin
- Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots to allow for recovery after accidental deletion
- The retention period can be specified between 1 day to 1 year
Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
- Force full initialisation of the snapshot to eliminate latency on first use
- Expensive
## AMI Overview
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are customised EC2 Instances, allowing for custom software, configurations, OSs, monitoring systems, etc. Usually has a faster boot / config as all the software is pre-packaged.
AMIs are built for a specific region, and can be copied across regions.
AMI configurations can be provided by AWS (Public AMI), developed in-house, or bought from a third-party vendor (AWS Marketplace AMI).

To create an AMI, you start with a base EC2 Instance, adjusting configurations and installing software as desired.
You then must stop the instance to preserve data integrity.
You then create an AMI from the EC2 Instance, this will copy configurations and installed packages, OSs, etc. This will also create EBS snapshots.
Launch an EC2 Instance via this new AMI.
## EC2 Instance Store
While EBS Volumes are network drives with good but limited performance, EC2 Instance Stores are high-performance hardware disks.
Instance Stores generally have better IO performance but are volatile.
They are good for buffers, caches, scratch data, etc.
Their volatility means they are vulnerable to hardware failure.
Backups and replication are the user's responsibility.
