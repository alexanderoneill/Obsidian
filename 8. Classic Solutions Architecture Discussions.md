## WhatsTheTime.com
- Stateless web app
- Displays the current time
- Doesn't need a database
- Can start small and can accept downtime
- Want to fully scale vertically and horizontally, removing downtime
Stage 1

Stage 2
![[Pasted image 20240220094913.png]]
- Vertically scaled, downtime while upgrading to M5 instance
Stage 3
![[Pasted image 20240220094956.png]]
- Horizontally scaled, users need to be aware of more IPs, more infrastructure that needs managed
Stage 4
![[Pasted image 20240220095138.png]]
- Users only need single point of access, downtime when instances are removed
Stage 5
![[Pasted image 20240220095419.png]]
- No downtime, changing instances manually becomes difficult
Stage 6
![[Pasted image 20240220095500.png]]
- Very stable architecture, vulnerable to Zonal disasters
Stage 7
![[Pasted image 20240220095553.png]]
- Highly available, resilient to failure, not very cost effective
Stage 8
![[Pasted image 20240220095655.png]]
- Highly available, resilient, and cost efficient
This application journey covers:
- Public vs Private IP and EC2 instances
- Elastic IP vs Route 53 vs Load Balancers
- Route 53 TTL, A records and Alias records
- Maintaining EC2 instances manually vs ASGs
- Multi-AZ to survive disasters
- ELB Health Checks
- Security Group Rules
- Reservation of capacity for cost savings
- We're considering the 5 pillars of a well architected application:
	- Costs
	- Performance
	- Reliability
	- Security
	- Operational Excellence
